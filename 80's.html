	<p>The early stages are Hip Hop is starting to come to an end and the evolution of it is being born during this decade of Hip Hop History. The iconic 80’s was what really set the foundation of what Hip Hop was in the 90’s, 2000’s, and the present. These ten years had artists that rapped about everyday life struggles and issues. This particular era had MC’s that wanted Hip Hop to last for generations to come and they did an exceptional job in accomplishing that goal. Also this era will always be considered “Ol Skool” and has really been a positive influence on artist and lyricist if today.
	Artist of the 80’s decade created the atmosphere of Hip Hop being positive, fun to listen to, and of course dance to. These artist and lovers of this era often did break dancing as a way to settle their problems rather than buying a gun ending someone’s life. Many MC’s such as Dana Dane and RUN DMC used to boast and brag. They considered themselves to be the best in the industry by bragging about their flow and quality of life. If MC’s had a problem with one another in the 80’s; they often battled their issues out through their lyrics and songs. Various artist such as Grand Master Flash, Sugarhill Gang, and LL Cool J used to wear gold chains to show how they were doing in life. It was mostly about bragging rights but toward the late 80’s this began to change and some may say the evolution of Hip Hop got a little darker.
