	<p>The 90’s was the decade after the proclaimed golden age of hip hop in the 80’s. Hip Hop stars such as Run DMC, LL Cool J brought their own little fresh definition of being hip, and new lyrics. While a group called NWA created a new form of rap called gangster rap. This new form of rap called gangster rap really took off in the early to mid-90’s, when a power move was made when Suge Knight created a group called Death Row Records in which he signed huge names like Tupac, Snoop Dogg, Dr.Dre. These artists were hugely known for their lyrics being violent and upfront, but also spitting bars about social issues in the Ghettos in America. Clothing-wise for the hip-hop 90’s scene was all about being saggy, but colors weren’t as loud as in the 80’s and also clothing like long sleeved flannels were brought to the light and artists also wearing flashy jewelry and luxury cars. The luxury that was being shown off by rappers like Biggie Smalls and other similar artists took rap to entirely new level in a commercial sense. Over time in the 90’s rappers started to focus on putting their efforts into flashing money and fancy cars in their music videos, which then started to turn into rapper based movies like Belly featuring DMX and a hot boyz movie starring the one and only Lil Wayne. Towards the mid and end of the 90’s is where that street side of hip hop appeared with certain artists like Jay-z, Nas and many more rappers. Their purpose was more focused on talking about street tales of growing up in the hood, drug dealing and shootings.
