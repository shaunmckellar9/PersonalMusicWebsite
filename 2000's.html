<p>There were many changes made from the 90’s era of Hip Hop to the 2000’s era. Things such as the flow of the lyrics, the lyrics themselves, and the beats that amplified the lyrics. Many changes were made because of the advancement of technology and world issue/views. During the early 2000’s Hip Hop era a lot of artists experienced their golden years in the industry. Artists from the 2000’s admired legendary MC’s and rappers from the 80’s and 90’s. During those two decades Hip Hop Evolution was created and has been the basis of the game sense. 
<br>
	Though various artists such as Kanye West and Dr. Dre often brought others together through collaborations there were many producers and lyrists that kept the battle of the coasts alive. Some of the artists that made their debut in the 2000’s changed the game by creating music that reflected more vulgar views of women and drugs. This has a major impact on society, young and old. For some the view of hip hop was not pleasant anymore and many people felt that Hip Hop was not what it was made to be. While others felt the need for the change. Some artist went with the evolution and changed how they rap and flowed. 
<br>
	Artist such as Snoop Dogg, T-Pain, Ludacris, 50 cent, Bow Wow, Jay-z, and Lil Wayne were all influential figures in the game. A few of the people mentioned in the above sentence did collaborations together and made music that will continue to be downloaded every day. Song’s Stuntin Like My Daddy by Lil Wayne feat. Birdman, Big Pimpin by Jay-Z feat. UGK, and Mr. Carter by Lil Wayne feat. Jay Z were some of those legendary collaborations. The 2000’s era of Hip Hop was arguably one of the best decades of Hip Hop Evolution. Check out the 2010's page to find out about the more recent information Hip Hop has to offer!
