	<p>The 2010’s to present rap has definitely shown progress from his previous predecessors in many ways. In present day hip hop a lot of artists are creating a lot of music that has no substance in them and only talk about killing, slandering women, money, and other things that aren’t actually positive. Thankfully though you do have a couple of artists who create music who have a great amount of substance and talk about things that many people are afraid to talk about or look at it as too sensitive to talk about. Some of these artist is Jermaine Cole, Kendrick Lamar, B.I.G. Krit, Wale, Joey Bada$$ and a couple of others. These artists serve as social activists who try and cast down from the known notion of current and previous rappers focus on money and luxury items and instead focus on things like being more socially aware, focusing on self-love, and other positive topics. Party Rap has been made a lot easier and more simplified with just short and catchy and simple rhyme schemes that has definitely led to a couple up and coming superstars like Lil Yatchy, Lil Uzi, Rae Srmmund and many more other artists who’ve used this route to get fame.
